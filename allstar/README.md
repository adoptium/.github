# Allstar configurations for the Adoptium organisation

[Allstar](https://github.com/ossf/allstar) is a GitHub App that
continuously monitors a subset of our organization's repositories
for adherence to security best practices.

It is configured to create issues on repositories that do not
comply with the configured policy.

The `yaml` files in this directory contain
[the list of repositories](allstar.yaml)
being checked and the various policies being enforced.
