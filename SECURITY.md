## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Eclipse Adoptium community take all security vulnerabilities seriously.
Thank you for improving the security of our projects. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Report security vulnerability by emailing the Eclipse Security Team at security@eclipse.org.

Report security vulnerability in third-party applications to the person or team maintaining the application.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a primary handler.
This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be
    released as fast as possible to npm.
